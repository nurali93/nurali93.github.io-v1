Hi uolls. Trying create a blog using github pages and powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as recommended by a friend/mentor [Zaid](https://zaidhuda.com). I found this [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) which was very easy to follow. Very simple and interesting. After setting up the blog foundation, I set up a wonderful template from [HTML5Up](https://html5up.net) which is totally free under the Creative Commons license. Now I need to brainstorm on what to put inside this blog. Maybe a resume? Rants? Who knows.

> Quit, don't quit... Noodles, don't noodles... You are too concerned about what was and what will be. There is a saying: yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present. - Master Oogway, [Kungfu Panda](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441773) (2008)
