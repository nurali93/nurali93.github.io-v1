    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
    <div style="text-align: justify !important;">
            <p>My current/past involvement in development usually revolves around class projects, freelance projects and internship projects. My technical skills are more focused on <strong>front-end development</strong>. For back-end side, basically I can do CRUD operations to simple middleware applications. I love Udemy.</p>

            <h2>System Development</h2>
            <p>For my degree's Final Year Project, me and my partner team up together to develop a management system for a clinic owned by my partner's dad. This project is developed using Laravel where my involvement is mostly on the client side and several tweaks at the back-end.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Intership Days</h2>
            <p>Just a simple mock up website that requested by a client during my internship. I used Boostrap 3 to develop the pages. This site is not live yet. Still waiting for confirmation.</p>
            <p>Produced together with Zul, company's senior designer where he guide and nurture me on what's good and bad design. It was halfway done and he trust me to finish it. The form handling part was developed using Javascript within Wordpress plugin.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Freelance Developer</h2>
            <p>An on-going side-project of me and my friend given by a group of researchers in a university to develop a web app for their implementation stage. This project has gone several major changes from a basic mobile app to and advance web application. We are currently using Angular JS and RubyonRails for this project development.</p>
