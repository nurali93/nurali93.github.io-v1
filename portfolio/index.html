    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
    <div style="text-align: justify !important;">
            <p>My current/past involvement in development usually revolves around class projects, freelance projects and internship projects</p>
			<hr>
            <h2>System Development</h2>
            <p>For my degree's Final Year Project, me and my partner team up together to develop a management system for a clinic owned by my partner's dad. This project is developed using Laravel where my involvement on front-end side was 100% and back-end 50%.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Intership Days</h2>
            <p>Just a simple mock up website that requested by a client during my internship. I used boostrap 3 to develop the pages. This project is still ongoing.</p>
            <p>Form handling using javascript.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Freelance Developer</h2>
            <p>An on-going side-project of me and my friend which started last December. We are hired by a group of researchers in a university to develop a web app for their implementation stage. This project has gone several major changes from a basic mobile app to and advance web application. We are using Angular JS and RubyonRails for this project development.</p>
